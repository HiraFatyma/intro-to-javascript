    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <P>Q1: What is javascript?
        <br>
        <br>
        Ans: javascript is basically a proramming language , it is the most important language as it defines functionality
        and behaviour of specific buttons to generate range, alert and search fields. It is actually a client side
        scripting language which means it gives a voice to client if he/she wants to search any thing it translate to
        servers inorder to receive http response. To use javascript we use script tag.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q2:Write down difference between declaration and initialization of a variable?
        <br>
        <br>
        Ans: To understand the difference b/w declaration and initialization we have to understand the variable, so
        variable act like a container to store information it have few keywords which we will discuss later now comes
        what is declaration ?? Declaration is actually giving name to a variable eg: (var java;) here var is variable
        and
        java is the declared name of that variable, now its time to understand initialization , so let me tell you to
        give value to the declared variable is called initialization eg:(java=language) here java is a declared variable
        and language is the value initialize lets do a quick example.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="ex">
            var java;
            <br>
            java="language";
            <br>
            document.write(java)
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <script>
            var java;
            java = "language";
            document.write(java);
        </script>
        <br>
        <br>
        The answer is language.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q3:In how many ways we can define a variable?
        <br>
        <br>
        Ans:variable can be defined in 3 ways
    <ol>
        <Li>
            var
        </Li>
        <Li>
            let
        </Li>
        <Li>
            const
        </Li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    Q4:Is variable case sensitive?
    <br>
    <br>
    Ans:yes, variables are case sensitive.N0 space should be given in b/w declared variables, no use of hyphen only $
    sign and _ works.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q5:When we declare a variable can we start it with number?
    <br>
    <br>
    Ans:No, we can't start a variable with a number first however we can use it inbetween or at end without spacing.

        <h1>TASK</h1>
        <P>TASK 1: Write a program that declare a variable using var keyword and initializes a value to it using a number data type</P>
        <br>
        var number;
        <br>
        number="1";
        <br>
        document.write(number)
        <br>
        <br>
        The answer is assigned value
        <script>
            var number;
            number=1;
            document.write(number)
        </script>

        <P>TASK 2:Write a program that declare a variable using constant keyword and initializes a value to it using a string data type </P>
        const playgroup="kindergarten";
        <br>
        document.write(playgroup);
        <br>
        The answer is 
        <script>

        <br>
        Task3:Write  a Program that takes two variables X and Y ,  store the result in a new variable Z  and prints a sum of it.

        <br>
        var y=4;
        <br>
        var z=(x+y);
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <script>
            var x=3;
            var y=4;
